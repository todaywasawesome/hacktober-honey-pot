Don't make junk submissions on popular open source repos, you can make them here. 

Open source maintainers don't want to handle your junk submissions. If you're going to submit junk, just submit it here so that maintainers can focus on great submissions. If you want to help out with great submissions PLEASE DO! Open source is an open effort for everyone, but spamming good repos with junk actually makes open source worse. 

So if you're going to spam anyway, just spam this repo. 

## Need an idea?
We're making a list of animals, countries, and more in the lists directory. If you know of an item that doesn't exist go ahead and add it!
